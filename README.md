# White Wine Quality Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the quality of white wine based on its physicochemical properties. Utilizing regression analysis, we aim to build a predictive model that can estimate wine quality from various input features. The dataset used for this project is contained within a CSV file that includes measurements like alcohol percentage, acidity, residual sugar, and others related to white wine samples.

## Folder Structure
This project is organized into several folders and files to ensure easy navigation and usage:

### `Data` Folder
- **wine+quality/**: Contains the `winequality-white.csv` file which houses the dataset used for all analyses.

### `HTML produced from markdown` Folder
This folder contains HTML files generated from markdown code files:
- **Wine_Quality_Analysis.html**: Contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the white wine data.
- **regression_modeling_and_evaluation.html**: Contains the regression modeling and evaluation steps.

### `Models` Folder
- Stores the best-performing model which is saved for deployment.

### `Preprocessing` Folder
- Contains the preprocessing model of the data, prepared specifically for deployment purposes.

### 'Report' Folder
- Contains the pdf report file of the project.
### Root Directory Files
- **deployment.R**: Contains the necessary R code to deploy the models.
- **regression_modeling_and_evaluation.Rmd**: A markdown file with code for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluating the data.
- **Wine_Quality_Analysis.Rmd**: A markdown file dedicated to performing EDA on the white wine dataset.

## How to Use
1. Ensure that you have R and the necessary packages installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the desired markdown files to explore the code or to the HTML files to view the pre-rendered analysis and results.
4. You can deploy the model using the `deployment.R` script provided in the root directory.
